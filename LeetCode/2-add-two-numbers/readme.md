[Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

## Challenge Description
Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, the digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

### Examples
- Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
- Output: [7,0,8]
- Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 9
- It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
