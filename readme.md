 # Algorithm Practice in JavaScript

Welcome to the repository where I share my journey of learning and improving algorithmic skills using. This repository is structured to provide a comprehensive learning experience with challenges sourced from multiple platforms.

## Repository Structure

Each platform from which challenges are sourced is represented by a separate directory within this repository. Under each platform's directory, individual challenges are organized into their own subdirectories. Each challenge subdirectory contains:

- README.md: Contains the challenge instructions and any relevant background information needed to understand the problem.

- data.js: A JavaScript file containing the data needed to solve the challenge.

- app.js: The JavaScript script that contains the solution to the challenge.

- test.js: The JavaScript test for verify the success of the challenge. 

## Objectives

- Training and Documentation: Documenting my approach to each challenge to track progress and share insights.

- Refactoring Opportunities: Using this repository as a reference to revisit and refine solutions as my JavaScript skills evolve.

## GPT's formatting

I use ChatGPT for formatting readme.md, data.js and test.js, you can acces to this GPT's [here](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68v9RmP15-algorithmes-challenge-formater), for giving the data to him, use this format : 

- Challenge name : 
- Challenge url : 
- Challenge description : 

The output was code zone with all the information, you juste need to copy & past before working on solution.
