 # Algorithm Practice in JavaScript

Welcome to the repository where I share my journey of learning and improving algorithmic skills using. This repository is structured to provide a comprehensive learning experience with challenges sourced from multiple platforms.

## Repository Structure

Each platform from which challenges are sourced is represented by a separate directory within this repository. Under each platform's directory, individual challenges are organized into their own subdirectories. Each challenge subdirectory contains:

- app.js: The JavaScript script with the solution to the challenge.
- README.md: For notes, reflections, and relevant information.

## Objectives

- Training and Documentation: Documenting my approach to each challenge to track progress and share insights.

- Refactoring Opportunities: Using this repository as a reference to revisit and refine solutions as my JavaScript skills evolve.

NB : You can use GPT for solve the problems, but it's better for you to learn and try to solve it.
