 # Algorithm Practice in JavaScript

Welcome to the repository where I share my journey of learning and improving algorithmic skills using. This repository is structured to provide a comprehensive learning experience with challenges sourced from multiple platforms.

## Repository Structure

Each platform from which challenges are sourced is represented by a separate directory within this repository. Under each platform's directory, individual challenges are organized into their own subdirectories. Each challenge subdirectory contains:

- README.md: Contains the challenge instructions and any relevant background information needed to understand the problem.

- data.js: A JavaScript file containing the data needed to solve the challenge.

- app.js: The JavaScript script that contains the solution to the challenge.

## Objectives

- Training and Documentation: Documenting my approach to each challenge to track progress and share insights.

- Refactoring Opportunities: Using this repository as a reference to revisit and refine solutions as my JavaScript skills evolve.
